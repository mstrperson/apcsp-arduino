# AP Computer Science Principles -- Arduino Edition
Included here are a few simple Arduino libraries I use for teaching AP Computer Science Principles with the Arduino.  They are, for the most part libraries that just encapsulate basic functionality that is tedious and confusing for absolute beginners.  For example, the `SerialReader` library encapsulates the Serial connection and gives useful methods like `readLine()` and `readInt()`.
## Intent
These libraries are a gateway to Object-Oriented design in C++ and are written explicitly for educational purposes more than memory or processing efficiency.
## Thoughts or Recommendations
If you like these libraries, or have any suggestions of useful additions or modifications, I'm happy to hear from you.  You can message me here or send me an email at [coxj@vt.edu](mailto://coxj@vt.edu).
